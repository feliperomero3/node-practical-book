# Practical node

Inspired by the book [Practical Node.js - Building Real-World Scalable Web Apps Second Edition][1] by Azat Mardan plus other additions.

I come from a .NET background and I want to know a bit more of node (I find myself wondering if Angular is based in node).

I'm adding all sorts of simple projects, one for each folder on this repository.

Cheers.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x

## Getting started

1. Clone the project.
1. Open a terminal in the root directory.
1. Change to any root level directory (there is one self-contained project for each directory).
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `node src/app.js`.
1. Open your web browser.
